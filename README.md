Principal Component Analysis 

This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python. It is structured into several key sections:

1. Libraries
This section includes the Python libraries necessary for performing PCA. Make sure to install these libraries before running the notebook.

2. The Data
An overview of the dataset used in this PCA implementation. It includes details on how to load and preprocess the data for analysis.

3. PCA Visualization
Visualizations are crucial for understanding PCA. This section provides code to plot the principal components and explains how to interpret these plots.

4. Interpreting the Components
A detailed explanation of how to interpret the components derived from PCA, providing insights into the data's underlying structure.
